## Whitelisted Integrations
This list is to be used by protocols covered by Sherlock. Any protocol covered by Sherlock can integrate with a protocol on this list. If a protocol on this list faces a covered exploit or loss of funds which affects another protocol covered by Sherlock, then Sherlock will repay that exploit as if it happened at the covered protocol. 

However, Sherlock will not "double cover" protocols. If Sherlock covers both Protocol #1 and Protocol #2 and 1M USDC is lost at protocol #1 and it also affects protocol #2, Sherlock will treat this case as if only one protocol faced the exploit. In this example, >1M USDC would never be paid out.
